## Features

* **Modern React Frontend Architecture:**  
  Functional components, React hooks, and Tailwind utility-first styling applied within a responsive layout derived from a Figma design system.

* **User Authentication & Data Modeling:**  
  Login and sign-up flows implemented through a basic authentication layer, with mock playlist data structured to mirror real API schemas and ready for integration with future backend endpoints.

* **Advanced UI Layout & Interactions:**  
  Masonry-style grid with infinite scroll, optimized rendering, and custom Tailwind animations for smooth, high-performance interactions.

* **Music Playback on Hover:**  
  Dynamic audio preview: songs play on hover in the dashboard, enhancing the user experience without requiring page navigation.

* **Giphy Picker Integration:**  
  Users can search for and attach GIFs to posts using an integrated Giphy API picker for richer content.

* **Music Search Functionality:**  
  Search across available songs directly within the platform, with results dynamically displayed for easy playlist additions.

* **Custom Banner Images for Playlists:**  
  Users can select unique banner images when creating playlists, adding a personalized visual touch.

* **Scalable Component Architecture:**  
  Modular and reusable components (cards, modals, grids) enable rapid expansion and future feature additions.

## Project Management

 * **Version Control & Collaboration:**  
  **Git** and **GitHub** were used for source control, branching strategies, and collaborative development with pull requests and code reviews.

* **Documentation & Communication:**  
  **Notion** was also used for maintaining design decisions, feature specifications, and workflow documentation to ensure clear team communication.

## Future Enhancements

* **Full API Integration:**  
  Replace mock data with real backend endpoints for playlists, users, and media items.

* **CRUD Functionality:**  
  Implement full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for playlists and songs, enabling dynamic data management.
